# Speech Assistant with Twilio Voice and the OpenAI Realtime API (Python)

This application demonstrates how to use Python, Twilio Voice and Media Streams, and [OpenAI's Realtime API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/) to make a phone call to speak with an AI Assistant.
The application opens websockets with the OpenAI Realtime API and Twilio, and sends voice audio from one to the other to enable a two-way conversation.
See [here](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/blog/voice-ai-assistant-openai-realtime-api-python) for a tutorial overview of the code.
This application uses the following Twilio products in conjunction with OpenAI's Realtime API:
- Voice (and TwiML, Media Streams)
- Phone Numbers
Note
Outbound calling is beyond the scope of this app. However, we demoed [one way to do it here](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/blog/outbound-calls-python-openai-realtime-api-voice).
